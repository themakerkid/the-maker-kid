Flask-Themes2 is a fork of Spirits, which is in turn a fork of Flask-Themes.

This provides infrastructure for themes in Flask.

This was created as Flask-Themes doesn't support versions of Flask past 0.6 (or 0.7, I'm not 100% certain),
and as such, it has been no use since the last update (which was in 2011, would you believe!).
