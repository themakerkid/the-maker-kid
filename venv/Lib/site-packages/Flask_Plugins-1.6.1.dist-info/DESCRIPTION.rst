Flask-Plugins
-------------

Flask-Plugins makes it possible, to create plugins for your
application. In addition to the plugin system, it also provides a simple
event system which can be used by plugins to extend your application without
the need to modify your core code.


And Easy to Setup
`````````````````

First of all, you have to install it:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install flask-plugins

and then you need to initialize it somewhere in your code.

.. code:: python

    from flask_plugins import PluginManager

    plugin_manager = PluginManager(app)

Want to use the factory pattern? No problem!

.. code:: python

    from flask_plugins import PluginManager

    plugin_manager = PluginManager()
    plugin_manager.init_app(app)
